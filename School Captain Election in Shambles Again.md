Yet again, the elections for our school leaders have been an absolute sheep-show. 

On the 2nd of February (Friday Week 1), an announcement was made on the Senior Campus noticeboard: if you're interested in becoming a School Captain, please fill out the form. Having the expression of interest form released on the first week of school is incredibly early, but alright. Could be a once off thing.

There was a chance that if you weren't fast enough, you could miss the opportunity to have your say. What if you're sick? What if you're busy? At least the prime minister election cycle has a whole weekend at minimum.

On top of that, on the updated form[^1], it wasn't possible to vote for two people! It wasn't configured as a tick box form, which can let you pick more than one option, there wasn't a second "who do you want for the other school captain?" box, and there certainly wasn't an option to
